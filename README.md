# KaraoPy
A simple software written in Python/Kivy focused on download karaoke videos from Youtube and make a automatic playlist from it. 

## Why?
After I could not make a reserve at a commercial karaoke with my friends, I made a party at home using a very simple Python/Kivy program to add URLs of karaoke videos from Youtube, download it, put in a playlist and play automatically in a TV connected do my notebook. I had time and energy to make it from a very small hobby project to a not-so-small-I-spend-too-much-time-on-this-help-me, resulting in this shit -- I mean, the beautifully constructed Python program. 

## Features
* Downloads video from Youtube (or any youtube-dl supported site), saves in a folder and puts in a playlist
* Uses vlc as player
* Simple csv database where the metadata from videos is stored
* Integrated database search

KEEP WRITING TOMORROW
